# PDFShdow

[ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README.zh-CN.md)

This is a multi-functional desktop application built with Electron, designed to provide a powerful and user-friendly suite of tools for processing PDF files. The application leverages worker threads to handle time-consuming tasks, ensuring the user interface remains smooth and responsive at all times.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Core PDF Processing

1.  **PDF Page Resizer**
    *   Resizes all pages of a PDF file to a user-specified width and height.
    *   Automatically maintains the aspect ratio of the original pages and centers the content within the new dimensions to prevent distortion.

2.  **Shein Label Generator (2-in-1 Merge)**
    *   A custom tool designed for specific e-commerce scenarios like Shein.
    *   It merges two PDF files: using each page of the second PDF as the top half of a new page, and placing the first page of the first PDF on the bottom half.
    *   Supports custom output page dimensions in millimeters (mm).

3.  **Multi-File Merge (3-in-1 Merge)**
    *   Merges three separate PDF files into a single, sequential PDF document.

4.  **PDF to Images (JPG in ZIP)**
    *   Converts each page of a PDF document into a JPG image.
    *   All generated images are then packaged into a single ZIP archive for easy distribution and use.

### Utilities & Tools

*   **File Operations**:
    *   Securely open PDF files and select output directories from the local machine.
    *   Directly locate the generated file in the file explorer after processing.
    *   **Copy File to Clipboard**: A convenient feature that copies the generated file itself to the system clipboard, not just the file path.
    *   One-click access to the application's official website.

*   **User-Friendly Interface**:
    *   A clean and intuitive UI with custom window controls (minimize, maximize, close).
    *   Provides real-time feedback for user actions (e.g., success, failure, processing) via toast notifications.

*   **Automatic Updates**:
    *   The application automatically checks for updates on startup.
    *   When a new version is available, it notifies the user and provides options to download and install, ensuring users have access to the latest features and fixes.

*   **Persistent Settings**:
    *   The application saves user settings (like the last used output directory), which are automatically loaded on the next launch for a smoother workflow.
